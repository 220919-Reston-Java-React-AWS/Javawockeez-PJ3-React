## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To run this on your own machine, simply download the code and its dependencies.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
You may open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser, although it will open automatically in your default browser when this command is run.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Any changes made to the tests while running will trigger a new run of the tests automatically. By default, only tests related to changed files will be ran, although this can be changed.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run coverage`

Tests all available tests in the project, and displays the coverage. Included is: 
- Name of the File
- Percent Coverage of
	- Statements
	- Branches (if and switch statements essentially)
	- Functions
	- Lines
- All Untested Lines in the tested module
